# Salary Prediction for Software Engineers

## Introduction

I successfully forecasted software engineer salaries in different countries by leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing software engineer profiles. To achieve this, I constructed a robust predictive model using Scikit-learn, optimizing its performance through cross-validation and grid search methodologies. Additionally, I applied advanced data preprocessing and exploratory techniques, harnessing the power of Python's Pandas and NumPy to ensure data accuracy and thorough analysis.

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project focusing on predicting the salaries of software engineers. It exemplifies the complete lifecycle of a machine learning application, encompassing data analysis, model training, model deployment, and user interface creation. The project is developed using Visual Studio Code as the integrated development environment, highlighting its versatility in handling data science and machine learning workflows. For the deployment of the machine learning model and the interactive user interface, Streamlit is employed, demonstrating a streamlined approach to bringing data models to a wider audience. This project serves as a comprehensive example of how modern tools and technologies are leveraged in machine learning to transform data into actionable insights and user-friendly applications.
